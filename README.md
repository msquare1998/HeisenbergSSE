# Stochastic series expansion algorithm for S=1/2 AFM Heisenberg model
I mean no offense, but I believe that old-fashioned languages like Fortran, which lack modern features, should fade out of history rather than continue to accumulate 'legacy' code. 

As for C++, I was once a C++ user, but the memory safety issues often drive me crazy. 

Regarding Julia, although I greatly appreciate the language, the elegance and rigor of Rust are highly appealing to me, as it offers both safety and performance. 

As a passionate Rust enthusiast, I am sharing here a SSE Rust code for reference, hoping to encourage more people engaged in physics algorithms and numerical research to switch to Rust programming. 

Unlike some uncommented code on GitHub, my code contains many comments. I believe that commenting is an important habit, and open-source contributions are also very important for physics research. I also welcome valuable suggestions for improving parts of my code.
